CodeIgniter-Initilizr-IonAuth
=============================

It has got the same features to that of codeigniter-initializr. The only addition to this is the integration of Ion Auth.
Also I have modifed the default design of the Ion Auth screens (Login, Create User, Manage User, Forgot Password,
Create Groups, Change Password) using Twitter bootstrap.

Installation Procedure:
1 - Download the zip file
2 - Extract it to the root of your web server
3 - Create a DB and run the sql queries mentioned below
4 - Change the DB properties in the /application/config/database.php
5 - Change the base url in the application config folder

That's it. Enjoy!!
