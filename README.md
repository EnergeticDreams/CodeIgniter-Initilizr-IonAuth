CodeIgniter-Initilizr-IonAuth
=============================

It has got the same features to that of codeigniter-initializr. The only addition to this is the integration of Ion Auth.
Also I have modifed the default design of the Ion Auth screens (Login, Create User, Manage User, Forgot Password,
Create Groups, Change Password) using Twitter bootstrap.
